+91 99893 76385: I suggest to go through the following material ( I collected from Internet) for first experiment (Lab) understanding purpose.
+91 99893 76385: Suggest to come with proper Idea to implement the same in your comfortable language using either BFS or DFS.
+91 99893 76385: Similarly refer the "Rich" textbook for "Water Jug Problem". Similar explanation available to understand.
+91 99893 76385: Try to implement any one of the above problem in this week.
+91 99893 76385: as per  your lab schedule.
+91 99893 76385: I hope you are able to view the due dates for each lab Assessment's on vtop.
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: Yes sir
+91 99893 76385: 1. COVID-19 related Research Topics: Applying ML/DL technique.
ansmission Methods: Detect mask wore or not? Properly wore or just available?
Distance following or not?
ing (Advanced DL): How to process COVID samples with privacy.
eas:
 based on image of a class room. It may be any audience scenario.
ance tracking based on entry and exit instead of Bio-metric punch-in/out.
e analysis in the above topics.
+91 99893 76385: Try to explore the ai being used in each sector
+91 99893 76385: Explore further like how they are benefiting exactly using AI
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: Sir could you once check the ppt on hill climbing search, some slides are not properly oriented and even after rotating the slide I am not able to read. It would be really helpful if you could change it.
+91 99893 76385: Choose rotate view option
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: I tried sir but for some slides it isn't working the content is not bounded in the slide, it moves out.
+91 99893 76385: View in full screen mode, CTRL+L
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: Okay sir
+91 99893 76385: Dear students, I have meeting now. please go through the CAT-1 syllabus and raise if you have any doubts.  Concentrate on all the three modules and also DA topic. This for morning class today
+91 99893 76385: If anybody submitted pdf format document for lab assessment-1 yesterday, please submit the word document through email immediately. Other platform submission not accepted. nagaraja.g@vit.ac.in
+91 99893 76385: Just suggestion
+91 73309 45676: It's AI powered personal assistant sir, like cortana for windows and siri for apple
Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: Maybe for Voice Commands.
Siddharth Vit Bbs Batchmate: Assistant for helping in driving...
+91 99893 76385: Anything more than personal assistant?
Siddharth Vit Bbs Batchmate: Like...lane changing... speeding....any warning..
+91 93483 43310: A/C temp control
+91 99893 76385: If only PA, then it's already there. False advertising
+91 76829 26742: Sir here ai means to assit drivers to keep the car in lane and maintain a safe distance from a car in front and cruise control etc
Saliq Iet Vit: Also hyper advanced ai based safety assistance
Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: driver-assist functions like Adaptive Cruise Control, Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking, etc...
Siddharth Vit Bbs Batchmate: Ooo....they may say we didn't mention that AI means artificial intelligenceü§£ü§£ü§£
+91 99893 76385: Need to explore how AI helps for these tasks
+91 99893 76385: Can you demonstrate/ explain, how can AI helps in these tasks in the upcoming class. @919565556292
+91 99893 76385: Not urgent. After your preparation only
Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: By using camera and sensors at the front of the car.
+91 99893 76385: If you fix camera and sensors, sufficient? They work themselves?
+91 99893 76385: I don't want answer like question one answer in CAT1. I want practical scenario
Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: They definitely will require proper programming for this..
Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: Ok sir I'll try
Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: üëçüèª
+91 99893 76385: üôè
+91 99893 76385: Thanks bro, but again CAT1 QUESTION ANSWER. I want in what way AI helps practically.
+91 99893 76385: Please take one task and demonstrate through example @918658322524
+91 99893 76385: Please come forward once you learned
+91 86583 22524: Sure sir !!
Prathik Vit Bbs Batchmate: In the above mentioned car, The AI part of it is only implemented for the personal assistant feature not for the advanced driver assists system (ADAS). ADAS uses various chips called Systems on a chip(SOC), which connects the sensors embedded in the chassis of the car to actuators through interfaces and directly linked to the Electronic Control Unit(ECU). As it is mentioned in the pdf sent above, the ADAS is at autonomous driving level 2. AI only gets implemented in autonomous driving from level 3 onwards till level 5. 
nt system that does use AI, uses Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding, it would give replies mimicing a normal human. It can also have control of the interior features of the car for example, opening the sunroof, or switching the radio station or making a call.
Aryaman Jr Research ACM: Thank you for sharing
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: Sir aren't you going to take the class today?
+91 99893 76385: Sorry. I thought it's at 3pm. Will compensate today's class later.

Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: i am rewriting the solution clearly
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: This is the final sir can you check now
+91 99893 76385: Answer is in ppt
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: It matches sir
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: This form is with regards to gathering the real time dataset for the lab assessment 4 (sentiment analysis). After getting enough responses I will share the dataset with everyone and it can be used as realtime dataset. Everyone is requested to fill the form seriously as this for the whole class.
 fill the form 2 times with 1 positive review and 1 negative
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: Everyone can use this as the class data set
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: and use a standard dataset as per sir's instructions
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: for real time
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: We have to use this one for real time right?
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: no, as class dataset
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: See w have to do two parts
Aniket Vit Bbs Batchmate: for real time do as per sir's instructions
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: No this itself is realtime
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: He gave two options
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: One is use this one or use twitter data
Gaurav Poosarla Vit Bbs Batchmate: We have to do the textbook one on paper
